Good resistance to corrosion by alkalis, sulphuric and hydrochloric acid. It oxidizes readily about 933K. There are two naturally occurring isotopes of vanadium, and 5 radioisotopes, V-49 having the longest half-life at 337 days. Vanadium has nuclear applications, the foil is used in cladding titanium to steel, and vanadium-gallium tape is used to produce a superconductive magnet. Originally discovered by Andres Manuel del Rio of Mexico City in 1801. His discovery went unheeded, however, and in 1820, Nils Gabriel Sefstron of Sweden rediscovered it. Metallic vanadium was isolated by Henry Enfield Roscoe in 1867. The name vanadium comes from Vanadis, a goddess of Scandinavian mythology. Silvery-white metallic transition element. Vanadium is essential to Ascidians. Rats and chickens are also known to require it. Metal powder is a fire hazard, and vanadium compounds should be considered highly toxic.

For\nexample consider iron (Fe):\n\n    >>> from mendeleev import Fe\n    >>> Fe.name\n    \'Iron\'\n    >>> Fe.atomic_number\n    26\n    >>> Fe.thermal_conductivity\n    80.4\n\nAnother, more flexible way is through the `element` method that returns\nthe `Element` object:\n\n    >>> from mendeleev import element\n\nThe `element` method accepts unique identifiers: atomic number, atomic\nsymbol or element\\\'s name in english. To retrieve the entries on Silicon\nby symbol type\n\n``` {.sourceCode .python}\n>>> si = element(\'Si\')\n>>> si.name\n\'Silicon\'\n```\n\nSimilarly to access the data by atomic number or element names type\n\n``` {.sourceCode .python}\n>>> al = element(13)\n>>> al.name\n\'Aluminium\'\n>>> o = element(\'Oxygen\')\n>>> o.atomic_number\n8\n```\n\n### Lists of elements\n\nThe `element` method also accepts list or tuple of identifiers and then\nreturns a list of `Element` objects\n\n``` {.sourceCode .python}\n>>> c, h, o = element([\'C\', \'Hydrogen\', 8])\n>>> c.name, h.name, o.name\n(\'Carbon\', \'Hydrogen\', \'Oxygen\')\n```\n\n#### Isotopes\n\nThe `isotopes` attribute returns a list of `Isotope` objects with the\nfollowing attributes per isotope\n\n-   `atomic_number`\n-   `mass`\n-   `abundance`\n-   `mass_number`\n\n``` {.sourceCode .python}\n>>> fe = element(\'Fe\')\n>>> for iso in fe.isotopes:\n...     print(iso)\n 26   55.93494  91.75%    56\n 26   56.93540   2.12%    57\n 26   57.93328   0.28%    58\n 26   53.93961   5.85%    54\n```\n\nThe columns represent the attributes `atomic_number`, `mass`,\n`abundance` and `mass_number` respectively.\n\n### Accesing data tables and the database\n\n[mendeleev](http://mendeleev.readthedocs.org) offers also methods for\naccessing whole tables of data, e.g. table with the data on all isotopes\nand methods for interacting directly with the database engine, for more\ndetails see the [API\ndocumentation](https://mendeleev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code.html#accessing-data)\nand [this\ntutorial](https://mendeleev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/02_tables.html).\n\n### Command line interface utility\n\nFor those who work in the terminal there is a simple command line\ninterface (CLI) for printing the information about a given element. The\nscript name is [element.py]{.title-ref} and it accepts either the symbol\nor name of the element or it\\\'s atomic number as an argument and prints\nthe data about it. For example, to print the properties of silicon type\n\n``` {.sourceCode .bash}\n$ element.py Si\n                            _  _  _  _      _\n                          _(_)(_)(_)(_)_   (_)\n                         (_)          (_)_  _\n                         (_)_  _  _  _  (_)(_)\n                           (_)(_)(_)(_)_   (_)\n                          _           (_)  (_)\n                         (_)_  _  _  _(_)_ (_) _\n                           (_)(_)(_)(_) (_)(_)(_)\n\n\n\nDescription\n===========\n\n  Metalloid element belonging to group 14 of the periodic table. It is\n  the second most abundant element in the Earth\'s crust, making up 25.7%\n  of it by weight. Chemically less reactive than carbon. First\n  identified by Lavoisier in 1787 and first isolated in 1823 by\n  Berzelius.\n\nSources\n=======\n\n  Makes up major portion of clay, granite, quartz (SiO2), and sand.\n  Commercial production depends on a reaction between sand (SiO2) and\n  carbon at a temperature of around 2200 °C.\n\nUses\n====\n\n  Used in glass as silicon dioxide (SiO2). Silicon carbide (SiC) is one\n  of the hardest substances known and used in polishing. Also the\n  crystalline form is used in semiconductors.\n\nProperties\n==========\n\nAbundance crust                                         282000\nAbundance sea                                              2.2\nAnnotation\nAtomic number                                               14\nAtomic radius                                              132\nAtomic radius rahm                                         232\nAtomic volume                                             12.1\nAtomic weight                                           28.085\nAtomic weight uncertainty                                  NaN\nBlock                                                        p\nBoiling point                                             2628\nC6                                                         305\nC6 gb                                                      308\nCas                                                  7440-21-3\nCovalent radius bragg                                      117\nCovalent radius cordero                                    111\nCovalent radius pyykko                                     116\nCovalent radius pyykko double                              107\nCovalent radius pyykko triple                              102\nCovalent radius slater                                     110\nCpk color                                              #daa520\nDensity                                                   2.33\nDipole polarizability                                    37.31\nDiscoverers                                     Jöns Berzelius\nDiscovery location                                      Sweden\nDiscovery year                                            1824\nElectron affinity                                      1.38952\nElectronic configuration                          [Ne] 3s2 3p2\nEn allen                                                 11.33\nEn ghosh                                              0.178503\nEn pauling                                                 1.9\nEvaporation heat                                           383\nFusion heat                                               50.6\nGas basicity                                             814.1\nGeochemical class                                        major\nGoldschmidt class                                    litophile\nGroup id                                                    14\nHeat of formation                                          450\nIs monoisotopic                                           None\nIs radioactive                                           False\nJmol color                                             #f0c8a0\nLattice constant                                          5.43\nLattice structure                                          DIA\nMelting point                                             1683\nMetallic radius                                            117\nMetallic radius c12                                        138\nMolcas gv color                                        #f0c8a0\nName                                                   Silicon\nName origin                    Latin: silex, silicus, (flint).\nPeriod                                                       3\nProton affinity                                            837\nSeries id                                                    5\nSpecific heat                                            0.703\nSymbol                                                      Si\nThermal conductivity                                       149\nVdw radius                                                 210\nVdw radius alvarez                                         219\nVdw radius batsanov                                        210\nVdw radius bondi                                           210\nVdw radius dreiding                                        427\nVdw radius mm3                                             229\nVdw radius rt                                              NaN\nVdw radius truhlar                                         NaN\nVdw radius uff                                           429.5\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\n`mendeleev` is free and always will be.

For\nexample consider iron (Fe):\n\n    >>> from mendeleev import Fe\n    >>> Fe.name\n    \'Iron\'\n    >>> Fe.atomic_number\n    26\n    >>> Fe.thermal_conductivity\n    80.4\n\nAnother, more flexible way is through the `element` method that returns\nthe `Element` object:\n\n    >>> from mendeleev import element\n\nThe `element` method accepts unique identifiers: atomic number, atomic\nsymbol or element\\\'s name in english. To retrieve the entries on Silicon\nby symbol type\n\n``` {.sourceCode .python}\n>>> si = element(\'Si\')\n>>> si.name\n\'Silicon\'\n```\n\nSimilarly to access the data by atomic number or element names type\n\n``` {.sourceCode .python}\n>>> al = element(13)\n>>> al.name\n\'Aluminium\'\n>>> o = element(\'Oxygen\')\n>>> o.atomic_number\n8\n```\n\n### Lists of elements\n\nThe `element` method also accepts list or tuple of identifiers and then\nreturns a list of `Element` objects\n\n``` {.sourceCode .python}\n>>> c, h, o = element([\'C\', \'Hydrogen\', 8])\n>>> c.name, h.name, o.name\n(\'Carbon\', \'Hydrogen\', \'Oxygen\')\n```\n\n#### Isotopes\n\nThe `isotopes` attribute returns a list of `Isotope` objects with the\nfollowing attributes per isotope\n\n-   `atomic_number`\n-   `mass`\n-   `abundance`\n-   `mass_number`\n\n``` {.sourceCode .python}\n>>> fe = element(\'Fe\')\n>>> for iso in fe.isotopes:\n...     print(iso)\n 26   55.93494  91.75%    56\n 26   56.93540   2.12%    57\n 26   57.93328   0.28%    58\n 26   53.93961   5.85%    54\n```\n\nThe columns represent the attributes `atomic_number`, `mass`,\n`abundance` and `mass_number` respectively.\n\n### Accesing data tables and the database\n\n[mendeleev](http://mendeleev.readthedocs.org) offers also methods for\naccessing whole tables of data, e.g. table with the data on all isotopes\nand methods for interacting directly with the database engine, for more\ndetails see the [API\ndocumentation](https://mendeleev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code.html#accessing-data)\nand [this\ntutorial](https://mendeleev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/02_tables.html).\n\n### Command line interface utility\n\nFor those who work in the terminal there is a simple command line\ninterface (CLI) for printing the information about a given element. The\nscript name is [element.py]{.title-ref} and it accepts either the symbol\nor name of the element or it\\\'s atomic number as an argument and prints\nthe data about it. For example, to print the properties of silicon type\n\n``` {.sourceCode .bash}\n$ element.py Si\n                            _  _  _  _      _\n                          _(_)(_)(_)(_)_   (_)\n                         (_)          (_)_  _\n                         (_)_  _  _  _  (_)(_)\n                           (_)(_)(_)(_)_   (_)\n                          _           (_)  (_)\n                         (_)_  _  _  _(_)_ (_) _\n                           (_)(_)(_)(_) (_)(_)(_)\n\n\n\nDescription\n===========\n\n  Metalloid element belonging to group 14 of the periodic table. It is\n  the second most abundant element in the Earth\'s crust, making up 25.7%\n  of it by weight. Chemically less reactive than carbon. First\n  identified by Lavoisier in 1787 and first isolated in 1823 by\n  Berzelius.\n\nSources\n=======\n\n  Makes up major portion of clay, granite, quartz (SiO2), and sand.\n  Commercial production depends on a reaction between sand (SiO2) and\n  carbon at a temperature of around 2200 °C.\n\nUses\n====\n\n  Used in glass as silicon dioxide (SiO2). Silicon carbide (SiC) is one\n  of the hardest substances known and used in polishing. Also the\n  crystalline form is used in semiconductors.\n\nProperties\n==========\n\nAbundance crust                                         282000\nAbundance sea                                              2.2\nAnnotation\nAtomic number                                               14\nAtomic radius                                              132\nAtomic radius rahm                                         232\nAtomic volume                                             12.1\nAtomic weight                                           28.085\nAtomic weight uncertainty                                  NaN\nBlock                                                        p\nBoiling point                                             2628\nC6                                                         305\nC6 gb                                                      308\nCas                                                  7440-21-3\nCovalent radius bragg                                      117\nCovalent radius cordero                                    111\nCovalent radius pyykko                                     116\nCovalent radius pyykko double                              107\nCovalent radius pyykko triple                              102\nCovalent radius slater                                     110\nCpk color                                              #daa520\nDensity                                                   2.33\nDipole polarizability                                    37.31\nDiscoverers                                     Jöns Berzelius\nDiscovery location                                      Sweden\nDiscovery year                                            1824\nElectron affinity                                      1.38952\nElectronic configuration                          [Ne] 3s2 3p2\nEn allen                                                 11.33\nEn ghosh                                              0.178503\nEn pauling                                                 1.9\nEvaporation heat                                           383\nFusion heat                                               50.6\nGas basicity                                             814.1\nGeochemical class                                        major\nGoldschmidt class                                    litophile\nGroup id                                                    14\nHeat of formation                                          450\nIs monoisotopic                                           None\nIs radioactive                                           False\nJmol color                                             #f0c8a0\nLattice constant                                          5.43\nLattice structure                                          DIA\nMelting point                                             1683\nMetallic radius                                            117\nMetallic radius c12                                        138\nMolcas gv color                                        #f0c8a0\nName                                                   Silicon\nName origin                    Latin: silex, silicus, (flint).\nPeriod                                                       3\nProton affinity                                            837\nSeries id                                                    5\nSpecific heat                                            0.703\nSymbol                                                      Si\nThermal conductivity                                       149\nVdw radius                                                 210\nVdw radius alvarez                                         219\nVdw radius batsanov                                        210\nVdw radius bondi                                           210\nVdw radius dreiding                                        427\nVdw radius mm3                                             229\nVdw radius rt                                              NaN\nVdw radius truhlar                                         NaN\nVdw radius uff                                           429.5\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\n`mendeleev` is free and always will be.
